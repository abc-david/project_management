MODULE: modules/project_management/tests/unit/test_vector_service.py
PURPOSE: Unit tests for project vector service
CLASSES:
    - TestProjectVectorService: Tests vector service operations
DEPENDENCIES:
    - pytest: For test assertions and fixtures
    - unittest.mock: For mocking ChromaDB
    - modules.project_management.services.vector_service: Module under test

This module provides unit tests for the ProjectVectorService class,
ensuring proper collection creation, vector storage, and validation.
